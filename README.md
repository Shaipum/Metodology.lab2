# Metodology.lab1
## Description
This program defines a class List with length, append, insert, delete, deleteAll, get, clone, reverse, findFirst, findLast, clear and extend methods.
## Variant
Number of my gradebook is 1222, and the remainder of division by 4 is 2 - my variant.

At first I had to code a list based on built-in arrays/lists and then change it to list based on built-in arrays/lists one-way linked ring list.
## How to launch the application:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shaipum/Metodology.lab2.git

## Conclusion
Unit testing is an important part of software development as it helps to ensure that the code works correctly and can catch bugs before going into production. In this project, testing helps ensure that the List class works as expected after refactoring and that all operations are implemented correctly. Therefore, unit testing is not a waste of time but should become an integral part of the development process as an investment in the future.
